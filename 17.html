                we were drinking together and i was so expressive that night till my cheeks were rosy and his laughs are close to my ear with his soft hair between my fingers. i kiss him right beside his smile and he pulls me closer with his delicato fingers gently wrapped around my wrist, whispering into my ear (he's maybe shy to say it out loud even though it's only us? what's he on about?), followed by a kiss on my jaw. (why did he do that with his nose?? why the tip of his nose and my cheek?? why whywhwyhwy) he got shy and dizzy, resting his head on my shoulder, placing his hand on my back for an embrace, and then raising his head to kissing my temple. (the way he leaned down for that hug tho, i couldn't help but move my hand from the back of his neck to his back and shoulders. the way he relaxed is cute) his scent soothes me, so I kiss his shoulder and he takes me in another hug (THE WAY HE HAD HIS HAND ON MY HEAD AND FELT MY HAIR MADE ME FEEL SO SAFE???) then he let his hand rub my back softly. he held my face before pulling away and i accidentally leaned and i accidentally kiss his throat and i accidentally looked at him and placed my hand on his shoulder to make him lean do again so i could accidentally kiss near his eye

                we decided to go on a trip and after having our fun we returned back to the hotel AND everyone was in their rooms. AND i wanted to see him? but not directly. like not in the i want to see you way (.❛ ᴗ ❛.). <br>

anyway, i knocked on my friend's door and told him something before asking him if bro dima is with him. he was (he literally asked not-so-cutely who?). so i told him to tell him hi for me? literally SO STOOPID. cause I wouldn't knock on his door and start talking with him??? he chuckled at the fact that I didn't just say it myself and even suggested i join them BUT NEVER. i just wanted an excuse to see him but i didn't exactly see anything  (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ. i was kinda jealous when he chose to stay with him instead of me but then i remembered they knew each other way before. once he heard my voice he tilted his head as if to peek???? then after i wished them goodnight and left, he closed the door.

                <b>02</b>; there was a little thingy on his clothes so when i pointed it out my fingertips lightly touched his sleeve then when he moved his hand to where that thingy is. i just watched him remove it :(( he looked so cute when removing it. <br>

                <b>03</b>; my elbow was resting on that table with my palm open. now why did he place his hand on my looking like my palm against the back of his fingers if i held his hand back. his causality and genuine smile made me do exactly like him.

            once we were in the same car and we didn't stop talking. we were close close like mu shoulder wasn't just touching his but over his shoulder! and he didn't mind at all. sometimes he'd lean onto my shoulder and his hair touching my jaw then i 'accidentally' raise my hand to tickle the underside of his chin or touch his necklace if he's wearing or just his clothes OR even his wrist cause the watch or that bracelet is interesting. he literally lets me do whatever i want.

           why that special attention on me when we're not hanging out alone ? it's not handsome at all, stop it. plus why these calls after the hangout is over? there was that time we had to split into two groups cause one car wouldn't have been enough. their uber arrived earlier (we're not in the same group and he kept throwing glances) anyway. after a few minutes later he called me and asked if our uber arrived and when i told him not yet,,, he wanted to stay on the phone for a bit cause apparently he had something to say but didn't want to in front all of them. my voice was soft just for him and i heard hustling chuckles sometimes. i think i'm falling in love (o_O) ?

            after i left that hangout with the group, i found him calling me 10 minutes later or something. i picked up after a few rings just to hear him say my name so beautifully. I ALMOST HANG UP THE PHONE. when i replied he was like "you're on your way now?" i was in the car already. what made me cry the most was the faded background noise and his voice... making it seem like a private moment. THEN HE FCKIN SAIDDD "i'm tired... so i'll be leaving soon too." as if i care. "i want you to know... then call me? call me (the audacity to say my name again!!?!)." i don't why his voice got softer and it sounded like he was asking me and hoping i would. i accidentally said "i can stay with you now too" i knew he wanted to keep on talking with me. he misses me a lot

            let's remember a precious moment; the time i lost my mind when his BARE back was facing me and his pendant on their back too, so… i was just be fighting the urge not to touch it but i did. he kinda flinched and his from my hand that all i could think of was how handsome his back looked when moving like that. then i thought my hand might've been cold so i pulled the blankets up a bit to cover his back. i hugged him and rested against his shoulder blade so he won't be able to run away.

if i accidentally asked him how was his day and he replied with “there was nothing special today. i just miss you very much.” i think i might commit homicide.

           YAA okok i'm so calm. there was this guy talking with me. he's nice and everything and somehow extra nice with his words... then he interrupted us with "hey love..." it was so cute and even cuter that he said while looking at me and not to make him leave away. then he turned to him and introduced himself. HE JUST SAID HIS FUCKING NAME. maybe it's obvious now. but at that night, he stole my heart. again.

idk what happened? we were talking and laughing and both of us had this lingering smile while still talking. i'm looking into his eyes but he isn't exactly looking back like he'd raise his head from time to time to look into my eyes. can't he keep that eye contact? he's smiling and all but it's just sooo cuteee???????(￣┰￣*) 
<br>
other times it's like when i turn my gaze back to him, he's also fast to look back... softly?? why is he playing with his necklace now? and nodding to my words why why why

something he'd definitely do is when you're arms touch or your shoulder or whatever and he doesn't move because sometimes he leans closer as if adjusting himself?? like shut up. he doesn't even look at me while doing it so casual.

                instead of calling me over, he would put in the effort of finding exactly where i am and dragging me where he wanted while calling my name softly as well ♡ (￣З￣)                        <p style="text-align: right">인생 ♡ </p>

               isn't it cute how they wouldn’t even notice your name slip through their mouth since they're so used to it. or like imagine this: when they are out with friends or something and one mentioned your name. they're like trying to calm their smile down and their mind from hanging out with you. zone out a little (o˘◡˘o)       <p style="text-align: right">인생 ♡ </p>

                he literally gave her the more appetizing plate while he just dumped everything on his.... man once when he was in a heated debate with his friends or something, he suddenly announced “b would agree with me” why are you so confident (・-・ ) ?                        <p style="text-align: right">인생 ♡ </p>

                how about THIS moment!! you two were sitting across from each other. his hand slightly clasped on the table in front of yall. while all the talking and stuff you too rest your hands on the table but not anywhere on the table. just right beside his hand?? like fr?? (you know both your hands beside his, almost like you're holding them) he noticed that and slightly and very noticeably let his hand fall to the side so if they could at least brush against yours. he's looking at this tiny action WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIS FUCKING EYES. HIS EARS WERE ALMOST RED. stop                        <p style="text-align: right">인생 ♡ </p>

               he's standing at the door wanting to enter but i don't want him to for whatever reason, which made him even more curious. the door was almost closed, it was just me between that gap. as he tries to let himself in, i put my hand on his chest to stop him. BABY YOU DIDNT EVEN NOTICE WHAT YOU DID OMG. he was almost about to tease me about what i'm hiding inside (he tilted his head so he could take a peek.) OMG OMGOKGNFIWJWJA HIS NECK?? I MEAN HIS PERFUME. uahsyshan anyway. this time i actually push him WITH MY HAND ON HIS CHEST, that made me leave the gap and get out for a second or so. BITDGSHWHW HE PUT HIS HAND ON TOP OF MINE WHEN HE NOTICED HOW I PUSHED HIM OUT AND HIS FUGLY HAND ON MY SIDE. OK now no more touching. he chuckled lightly before turning to look at me and "I just wanted to ask you if I can see you tonight." THEN I'D HIT HIM WITH THE FORMAL. work yk. he'd be a bit disappointed but i wouldn't care anyway. then he'd nod.

♡ you come up behind them and wrap your arms around their shoulders and they just kiss your arm??<br>
♡ you should probably take your bikes and go somewhere and look at the lake and fall in love<br>
♡ showing them your new haircut in the car when driving you home and their reaction is the cutest <br>
♡ you're sitting on the table and they leans down (since that mf is already standing..feel me?) to tell you something or whatever;; ha so nice <br>
♡ when they kick your chair, "accidentally" bump their shoulder to your back, slide their hand down your arm. to get attention?<br>
♡ lay their head on your lap when you’re watching a show and asks you about the plot <br>
♡ insists on carrying all the groceries even if you offer to help and gives you their hand to hold or the lightest bag to hold instead<br>
♡ petals falling gently down, they pick off a small blossom that lands on your hair<br>
♡ when they kiss your shoulder to feel this sense of protection from you <br>
♡ they would kiss your hand to wake you up from falling asleep in the car <br>
♡ when they reach for the glove box in the car and you put your hand on theirs.
