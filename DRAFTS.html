           i touched his elbow and when he let his arm fall, my hand slid down his forearm til i reached his hand... we held hands a bit behind his back (as he was pulling me closer then left my hand and kept his on my back then my shoulder blade like shut up)

            last night, before he left, we suddenly started arguing over some matters. i turned my back to him and remained silent. he pulled me a few times, but i still didn't respond. i told him to leave early because i had a pile of things to do tomorrow. he sighed and said he was leaving. when i heard him packing things in the living room, i couldn't help but cry. while crying, he came back, squatted by the bed, and held my face for a long time. i asked him if he wouldn't come back if he didn't hear me cry. he said it's not like that. i asked him what he was doing outside. "well... can't I run a bit and then come back to comfort you? i also have to save face, you know.." i listened to his words and found them funny and annoying. before i had a chance to wipe away my tears, he kissed my eyes.

          we didn't make any love at the hotel these 2 nights. we were just sat on the bed talking (he's hiding under the blanket because he refuses to wear a shirt and the room is cold so he just hugs me instead) while we kiss sometimes? i hate kissing honestly ew ew. so its always soft one on places other than lips. AND if it's the lips then just the corner of lips OR HIS UPPER LIP THATS ALL I CANANWIWU. he likes it and leans closer but no SHUT UP !!! THE WAY HIS NECK AND JAW LOOK WHEN HE KEEPS LEANING FORWARD LIKE A FOOOOOOL AHAHAUUAI. his hands are gently and i'm trapped and he's looking up at me with love and smiley eyes. when he laughs he likes to get even closer by hiding against me. THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE CANT KEEP HIS HAND TO HIMSELF WHEN KISSING. they are always on me somewhere. (the hand resting with below my collarbone when kissing my cheek stole my breath)
